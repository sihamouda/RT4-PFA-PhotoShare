This project was done as the End-of-year project during my engineering studies at INSAT where, alongside my colleague, have successfuly designed and implemented a cloud-native architecture in a mono-repo managed by Turbo. One of our goals was to minimize vendor dependency by utilizing open-source tools and stateless services. Key technologies such as Consul, RabbitMQ, Prometheus, Grafana, PostgreSQL, and MinIO are employed to ensure portability and flexibility across various cloud environments.
